Headers are useful to put at the top of websites and they usually contain a [Nav bar](navigation) for navigation.
```html
<header class="tn-header">
  <div class="tn-row tn-container">
    <h1 class="tn-col-1-3 tn-website-title">Website Title</h1>
    <nav class="tn-col-2-3">
      <!-- Navigation -->
    </nav>
  </div>
</header>
```

This is how to setup the header, you can also add [colors](colors) to personalise and you can use a [grid](grid) to neatly organise it.
